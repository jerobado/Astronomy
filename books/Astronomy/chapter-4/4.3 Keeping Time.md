# 4.3 Keeping Time

**Objective**
 - [x] explain the difference between the solar day and the sidereal day
 - [x] explain mean solar time and the reason for time zones
 
 **solar day**
 - the rotation period of Earth with **<u>respect to the Sun</u>**
 - 4 minutes longer than the sidereal day
 
 **sidereal day**
 - the rotation period of Earth with **<u>respect the the stars</u>**
 - use mostly by astronomers
 
 **apparent solar time**
 - time reckoned by the actual position of the Sun in the sky (or, during the night, its position below the horizon)
 
 **mean solar time**
 - which is based on the average value of the solar day over the course of the year
 - a mean solar days contains exactly 24 hours and is what we use in our everyday timekeeping
