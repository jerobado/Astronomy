Seasons are caused by the Earth's axis tilted by **23.5°**.

As Earth travels around the Sun, in June the Northern Hemisphere “leans into” the Sun and is more directly illuminated. 

In **December**, the situation is reversed: the Southern Hemisphere leans into the Sun, and the Northern Hemisphere leans away. 

In **September** and **March**, Earth leans “sideways”—neither into the Sun nor away from it—so the two hemispheres are equally favored with sunshine.
