**Objectives**
- explain what determines the strength of gravity
- describe how Newton's law of gravitation extends our understanding of Kepler's laws

Newtown's law of universal gravitation
---

**Weight** - is the force of gravity on the surface of Earth that gives our sense of _weight_. Your weight depends on the locasl force of gravity

**Mass** - would remain the same on any planet or moon

Gravity is a “built-in” property of mass. Whenever there are masses in the universe, they will interact via the force of gravitational attraction. The more mass there is, the greater the force of attraction.

The Sun’s gravitational pull joins with the pull of billions of others stars to create the gravitational pull of our Milky Way Galaxy. That force, in turn, can make other smaller galaxies orbit around the Milky Way, and so on.

Orbital Motion and Mass
---

**Orbital motion** - the motion of Earth and other bodies around the Sun. Orbital motion occurs whenever an object is moving forward and at the same time is pulled by gravity toward another object.

We can calculate the mass of an object like the Sun based on the distance and orbital periods of the planets!
