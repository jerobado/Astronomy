**Tycho Brahe** - known for accurately and comprehensively making astronomical observations

**Johannes Kepler** - known for his _law of planetary motion_

Kepler is the apprentice of Tycho Brahe.

Kepler's Law

1st Law (orbit)
- the orbits of all the planets are ellipses

**orbit** - the path of an object through space

**ellipse** - a plane curved surronding two focal points

**semi-major axis** - distance from the center of an ellipses to one end

**major axis** - the widest diameter

**eccentricity** - is the roundness of an ellipse. the closer the foci, the rounder the ellipse (0 is round, 1 is flat)

2nd Law (orbital speed)
- the imaginary line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps equal areas of space during equal time intervals as the planet orbits.
