### Motion sof Satellites and Spacecraft

Newton already envisioned an idea about orbit as shown in his diagram _De Munde Systemate_, 1731 edition

**circular satellite velocity** - the speed needed for a satellite to orbit a complete circle is about **<ins>8 kilometers per second</ins>**

**escape velocity** - the speed needed to escape the Earth's gravity is about **<ins>11 kilometers per second</ins>**
