**Astronomy** - is the study of celestial objects beyond planet Earth and the process by which these objects interact with one another.

**Scientific Notation** - is a way of expressing big numbers or too small numbers into conventiently writtin in decimal form.

Example:

|Decimal notation   |Scientific notation  |
|------------------:|:-------------------:|
|2                  |2 x 10<sup>0</sup>   |
|300                |3 x 10<sup>2</sup>   |
|0.2                |2 x 10<sup>-2</sup>  |
|-53000             |-5.3 x 10<sup>4</sup>|

**ligh-year** - distance travelled by light in one year, equiavalent to 3 x 10<sup>5</sup> km/s

**Your place in the universe**

You --> Earth --> Solar System --> Milky Way --> Local Group --> Virgo Supercluster

**How empty is space?**
- for each cm<sup>3</sup> of the air we breathe there has about 10<sup>19</sup> atoms
- in the interstellar gas of the Galaxy, there is about one atom in every cm<sup>3</sup>
- to find one atom in intergalactic space, on average we must search through a m<sup>3</sup> of space!
